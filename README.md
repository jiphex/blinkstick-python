# Blinkstick-Python

Some toys to change colours on the Blinkstick LED controller over an MQTT connection, specifically the [Blinkstick Strip](https://www.blinkstick.com/products/blinkstick-strip) at the moment.

## Dependencies

    pip install paho-mqtt colour blinkstick
    
Blinkstick isn't actually required on the sending client.
